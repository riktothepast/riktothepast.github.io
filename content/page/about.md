My name is Ricardo 'Rik' Illescas, I have been programming since a while now, doing projects in C#, Bash, Node.js, Visual Basic, Ruby.
I love to develop video games in my free time, do some pixel art and ride my bicycle werever I can.

Currently I'm working as a software engineer, developing back-end services in Node.js.
